classification (got labels used, supervised learning) vs clustering (no labels, unsupervised learning)

KNN - classification - calculate the distance between data points and make a prediction
logistics regression -assume data linear relationship, Logistic Regression is usually used to predict result according to the probability.
decision tree - can handle non-linear relationship, prone to overfitting, To use Decision Tree, you should transform the continuous variable into categorical.

Precision: High Precision = few false positive
Recall: High Recall = Few false negative
Typically, we want higer recall than precision. To improve both measures, either increase the data sample size to run more iterations or fine tune the model variables
