General Assembly Data Science Course - Project Idea

The dataset is sourced from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients

The idea is to apply classification techniques to the dataset and see if it's possible to identify features that will have a high probability of predicting credit card default. Current idea is to try using decision tree techniques and cross validate the model using logistics regression. Not much work at the moment, still exploratory stage.
